<p>The <strong>Android SDK and AVD Manager</strong> lets you
update your Android SDK without a visit to the
Android Developers web site. Instead of downloading an entirely new SDK
that includes Android platforms, tools, and documentation, you can instead
install only the individual packages that you want.</p>

<p>For example, when a new version of the Android platform is made available
for developing applications, use the SDK and AVD Manager to install the
platform into your existing SDK directory. You can then use the new platform
in your <a href="{@docRoot}guide/developing/tools/avd.html">AVDs</a> and
build your apps against it.</p>

<p>The benefit to using this feature is that your SDK directory will
remain the same. You don't need to reset the SDK location in
your Eclipse preferences or modify your {@code PATH} environment variable,
because all new packages are installed into your existing SDK directory.</p>


<p>The SDK and AVD Manager can be opened in two ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Execute the 
  <a href="{@docRoot}guide/developing/tools/othertools.html#android">{@code 
  android}</a> tool with no options, or</li>
  <li>From Eclipse, select <strong>Window</strong> > <strong>Android 
  SDK and AVD Manager</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The screenshot below shows the Android SDK and AVD Manager
with the Available Packages open.</p>

<h2 id="Install">Installing SDK Packages</h2>

<p>When a new Android SDK platform, add-on, set of development tools or
documentation becomes available, you can quickly download and
install them into your existing Android SDK:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select <strong>Available Packages</strong> in the left panel.
  This will reveal all packages currently available for download.</li>
  <li>Select the packages you'd like to install and click <strong>Install
  Selected</strong>.</li>
  <li>Verify and accept the packages you want and click <strong>Install
  Accepted</strong>. The packages will now be installed into your existing
  Android SDK directories.</li>
</ol>

<p>New platforms are automatically saved into the 
<code><em>&lt;sdk_dir>/</em>platforms/</code> directory of your SDK;
new add-ons are saved in the <code><em>&lt;sdk_dir>/</em>add-ons/</code>
directory; and new documentation is saved in the existing
<code><em>&lt;sdk_dir>/</em>docs/</code> directory (old docs are replaced).</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Tip:</strong>
Use the "Display updates only" checkbox to show only the packages
you do not have.</p>


<h2 id="Add">Adding SDK Package Sites</h2>

<p>By default, <strong>Available Packages</strong> only shows 
the Google repository for Android SDK packages and Google API
add-ons. You can add additional sites that host
Android SDK add-ons, then download add-on packages from them.</p>	

<p>For example, a mobile carrier or hardware manufacturer may offer additional
API libraries that are supported by their own Android-powered devices. 
In order for you to develop using their libraries, you may need to install an 
Android SDK add-on.
If the carrier or manufacturer has hosted an add-on repository file on their
web site, add their site to the SDK and AVD Manager:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select <strong>Available Packages</strong> in the left panel.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Add Site</strong> and enter the URL of the 
{@code repository.xml} file. Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any SDK packages available from the web site will now be listed and
available for you to install in your existing Android SDK.</p>
