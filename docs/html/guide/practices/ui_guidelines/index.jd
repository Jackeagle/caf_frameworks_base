icons in menus, dialogs, tabs, the status bar, and lists. The Icon Guidelines

  <dd>Activities are the basic, independent building blocks of applications.
      As you design your application's UI and feature set, you are free to
      re-use activities from other applications as if they were yours,
      to enrich and extend your application.   These guidelines
      describe how activities work, illustrates them with examples, and
      describes important underlying principles and mechanisms, such as
      multitasking, activity reuse, intents, the activity stack, and 
      tasks. It covers this all from a high-level design perspective.
